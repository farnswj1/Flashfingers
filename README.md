This program allows users to improve their typing speed. The user will be given four difficulties to choose from. Once a difficulty has been chosen, the user must type out the text on the screen as fast and accurately as possible. As the difficulty increases, the text to copy increases in length and a wider range of characters are more likely to appear. Once the string has been typed out, the user can press Enter on the keyboard, where the results will be computed.The results will show the user the time taken to type out the text as well as the accuracy. The user is free to do as many sessions as desired.
